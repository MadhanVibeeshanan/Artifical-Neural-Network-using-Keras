# Artifical-Neural-Network-using-Keras
This is the python project to classify the clothes using ANN 

Build a fully connected neural network using Keras with hidden layer 1 containing 784 neurons, hyperbloic tangent as activation function.
Hidden layer 2 containing 512 neurons and sigmoid as activation function, Hidden layer 3 containing 100 neurons, rectifier as activation function. Output layer containing 10 neurons, softmax as activation function. 

The Dataset was splitted into 80% training and 20% testing dataset.
